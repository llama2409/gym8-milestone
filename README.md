# GYM8-Milestone

GYM8 is a fictional gym website created for my milestone project as part of my Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development. The goal of this project was to design and build a clean, responsive, and user-friendly website using HTML and CSS while demonstrating good structure, accessibility, and design principles.

## Rationale

The purpose of this project is to simulate a real-world gym website. Most people browse a gym's website before deciding to get a membership or visit, so it's important to have a website that clearly presents information and is easy to navigate.

## Features

- Homepage with a clear introduction for the gym
- Gallery page showcasing equipment, community, and environment
- Contact page with an easy to use form to submit messages
- Clear and modern styling
- Fully responsive design for mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screen sizes

## Target Audience

- Current members looking to find information about their local gym easily
- Potential members curious about the environment and pricing before joining

## User Stories
As a fitness enthusiast:
- I want to browse a gallery of gym facilities and equipment,
 so that I can decide if this gym meets my workout needs.

As a mobile user:
- I want the website to be responsive and easy to navigate on my phone,
so that I can explore the website conveniently on the go.

As a potential new member:
- I want to view images of the gym's environment and equipment,
so that I can get a visual feel for the space before signing up.

As a first-time visitor:
- I want to easily find information about different memberships for the gym,
so that I can decide if the pricing is true to the environment.

## âœ… Testing

### Functionality Testing

All pages and navigation links were manually tested to ensure they work as expected:

- Navigation links (Home, Gallery, etc.) redirect correctly
- Images load properly on all pages
- External links open in a new tab (e.g., social media icons)
- All content displays clearly on different screen sizes

### Responsiveness Testing

The website was tested on various screen sizes and devices using:

- Developer Tools in Google Chrome (responsive view)
- Real mobile device (iPhone / Android)
- Different resolutions (desktop, laptop, tablet)
  
All content resized appropriately and layout adjusted for each screen size.

### Browser Compatibility

The website was tested in the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge

All browsers displayed consistent layout and behavior.
